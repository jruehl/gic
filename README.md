The R scripts in this repository can be used to reproduce the numerical results in the manuscript
'General Independent Censoring in Event-Driven Trials with Staggered Entry' (RÃ¼hl, Beyersmann, Friedrich):

- The script 'Simulations_calendar_times.R' includes the R code to reproduce the 
  results of the first simulation study.
- The script 'Breslow_estimators.R' includes the R code to reproduce the shadow plots 
  of the Breslow estimators based on the output of 'Simulations_calendar_times.R'.
- The script 'Bootstrap_functions.R' includes the R code to derive bootstrap confidence intervals
  for illness-death data without recovery (as used for the second simulation study and the real data analysis).
- The script 'Simulations_bootstrap.R' includes the R code to reproduce the results of
  the second simulation study.
- The script 'OAK_analysis.R' includes the R code for the analysis of the OAK study.
